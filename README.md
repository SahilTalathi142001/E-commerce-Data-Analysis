# **E-commerce Data Analysis Pipeline (Python, MySQL, Power BI)**

Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline for an e-commerce dataset, integrating Python for data processing, MySQL for database management, and Power BI for data visualization. The goal is to extract valuable business insights from raw data, automate data handling processes, and create interactive dashboards for easy analysis and reporting.

## Key Features

### Automated Data Ingestion:

* Python scripts automate CSV file ingestion into a MySQL database.
* pandas used for data cleaning and preprocessing, dynamically creating SQL tables and inserting data.

### Data Analysis with SQL:

#### Performed key analyses, such as:
* Total sales by month and year
* Average products per order by customer city
* Percentage revenue distribution by product category
* Seller rankings by total payments
* Customer distribution by state
* Number of orders placed per month in 2018
Power BI Dashboards:

#### Visualized insights using Power BI dashboards:

* Total Sales by Month and Year
* Average Products per Order by Customer City
* Percentage Distribution by Category
* Total Payments by Seller
* Customer Count by State
* Number of Orders per Month in 2018

## Technologies Used

* Python: For automating data ingestion and processing (pandas and os modules).
* MySQL: For storing and querying the dataset.
* Power BI: For creating insightful visual dashboards.
